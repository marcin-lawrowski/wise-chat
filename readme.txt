= I can't see translation for my language. How to localize the chat for end-user? =

You can do it by yourself. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Localization tab and translate texts in each field into your own language. These are all texts that are exposed to end-users.

= What about the support for mobile devices and responsiveness? =

Wise Chat plugin works on any mobile device that supports Javascript and cookies. The interface is responsive, but you should enable submit button in order an user could send a message. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Appearance tab and select checkbox "Show Submit Button". 

= The chat generates anonymous names for every new user. How to force every user to choose their name on first use? =

You can enable a form that appears every time a new user tries to enter the chat. The form displays username field and allows to enter the chat only if the user type his/her name. Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select General tab and select option "Force Username Selection".

= How does the bad words filter work? =

The plugin has its own implementation of bad words filtering mechanism. Currently it supports two languages: English and Polish. It is turned on by default. It detects not only simple words but also variations of words like: "H.a.c_ki.n_g" (assuming that "hacking" is a bad word).

= How to ban an user? =

Log in as an administrator and go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Moderation tab. Enable "Enable Admin Actions" option and go to a page containing the chat. Next to each message there should be a button that allows to ban an user for 1 day.

Alternatively log in as an administrator and type the command:
`/ban [UserName] [Duration]`
where "UserName" is the chosen user's name and "Duration" is constructed as follows: 1m (a ban for 1 minute), 7m (a ban for 7 minutes), 1h (a ban for one hour), 2d (a ban for 2 days), etc. Notice: IP addresses are actually blocked. 

Alternatively you can go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Bans tab. In "New Ban" row specify: IP address, duration and finally click "Add Ban" button.

= How to get the list of banned users? =

Log in as an administrator and type the command:
`/bans`
or go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page and select Bans tab.

= How to remove a ban of an user? =

Log in as an administrator and type the command:
`/unban [IP address]`
or go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Bans tab and then delete the desired ban from the list.

= How to get some information (e.g. IP address) about an user? =

Log in as an administrator and type the command:
`/whois [UserName]`
where "UserName" is the chosen user's name.

= How to use messages history feature? =

Click on the message input field and use arrow keys (up and down) to scroll through the history of recently sent messages.

= How to prevent from accessing the chat by anonymous users? =

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select General tab and select "Only regular WP users" in "Access Mode" combo box. From now an user has to be logged in as a regular WordPress user in order to gain access to the chat.

= How does auto-ban feature work? =

There is a counter for each user. Every time an user types a bad word in a message the counter is increased. If it reaches the threshold (by default set to 3) the user is banned for 1 day (the duration is configurable).

= How to delete a single message from the channel? =

Log in as an administrator. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Moderation tab and enable "Enable Admin Actions" option. From now every message in every channel has its own delete button ("X" icon). The button appears only for logged in administrators (or other choosen role). Use the button to delete desired messages.

= How to give message deletion permission to certain user roles? =

Log in as an administrator. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Moderation tab and enable "Enable Admin Actions" option. Next, in "Delete Message Permission" field select a role that is allowed to delete messages. From now users belonging to the selected role have permission to delete messages.

Alternatively: add "wise_chat_delete_message" capability to a role you want to have that permission. It could be either standard WordPress role or a custom role. 

= How does "Enable Images" option actually work? =

If you enable "Enable Images" option every link posted in the chat which points to an image will be converted into image. The image will be downloaded into Media Library and then displayed on the chat window. Those downloaded images will be removed from Media Library together with the related chat messages (either when removing all messages or a single one). If an image cannot be downloaded the regular link is displayed instead. 

= Option "Enable Images" does not work. I see regular hyperlinks instead of images. What is wrong? =

The option requires a few prerequisites in order to operate correctly: GD and Curl extensions must be installed, Media Library must operate correctly, posted image link must have a valid extension (jpg, jpeg, gif  or png), HTTP status code of the response must be equal 200, image cannot be larger than 3MB (the default limit that can be adjusted in settings). Try to read PHP logs in case of any problems. 

= What if I would like the images to be opened in a popup layer using Lightbox? =

By default all images open using Lightbox 2 library but only if the library is installed within current theme or a dedicated plugin. Without Lightbox 2 each image opens in the new tab / window.

= I have installed a plugin containing Lightbox library and newly added messages are not displayed on the Lightbox layer. What is wrong?

If you installed a plugin that incorporates Lightbox library and it still doesn't work make sure that the plugin uses original Lightbox 2 Javascript library. The chat is compatible only with the original Lightbox 2 library. 

= Image uploader does not work. What is wrong? =

Uploading of images is supported in the following Web browsers: IE 10+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, Opera 27+, iOS Safari 7.1+, Android Browser 4.1+, Chrome For Android 41+.

= How to replace specific phrase in every message posted by users? =

You can use filters feature. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Filters tab and add new filter. From now each occurrence of the phrase will be replaced by the defined text in every message that is posted to any chat channel.

= Chat window is showing up but it does not work. I cannot receive or send messages. What is wrong? =

Ensure that jQuery library is installed in your theme. Wise Chat cannot operate without jQuery. 

= Wise Chat plugin is making a lot of long-running HTTP requests. How to improve the performance? =

Every 3 seconds the plugin checks for new messages using AJAX request. By default admin-ajax.php is used as a backend script and this script has poor performance. However, it is the most compatible solution. If you want to reduce server load try to change "AJAX Engine" property to "Lightweight AJAX". It can be set on Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Advanced tab and then select "Lightweight AJAX" from the dropdown list. This option enables dedicated backend script that has a lot better performance. 

= How to customize CSS styles using "Custom CSS Styles" setting? =

All CSS classes related to the chat begins with "wc" prefix. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Appearance tab, go to Advanced Customization section. Use "Custom CSS Styles" field to specifiy your own definitions of Wise Chat CSS classes. Valid CSS syntax is required. 

= How to backup messages posted in a channel? I would like to save all messages for offline reading. =

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab and click "Backup" link next to the desired channel. All messages from the selected channel will be downloaded as a CSV file. You can open it using MS Excel, OpenOffice or any other editor that supports CSV format. 

= Are old messages being deleted from the chat window? =

By default - no, however, you can enable auto-cleaning messages feature. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab. In the field "Auto-remove Messages" type number of minutes. Messages older than given amount of minutes will be auto-deleted. 

= How to limit the amount of users that are allowed to enter a channel? =

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab. In the field "Users Limit" type number of users that allow to participate in a channel.  

= How to limit the amount of channels that an user can participate simultaneously? =

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab. In the field "Channels Limit" type number of channels that an user is allowed to participate simultaneously.  

= How to reset username prefix (a number that is added to anonymous users name) anonymous users? =

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select General tab and click "Reset Username Prefix" button.  

= When I upload an animated GIF the thumbnail is not animated. What is wrong? =

WordPress has no support for resizing animated GIFs. 

= Why I can change background color of the chat window but I cannot change background color of the input field, buttons or borders? =

It is impossible to provide options to customize every aspect of user interface. Please use CSS styles to adjust styles to your needs.

= I have uploaded a picture with incorrect orientation and the plugin did not corrected it. What is wrong? =

Plugin detects EXIF data in images. If an image doesn't have this data then nothing will happen. If EXIF data indicates that the orientation is correct then also nothing will happen.

= I am experiencing errors like "Fatal error: Call to undefined function openssl_pkey_get_public() (...)". What is wrong? =

Make sure that openssl extension for your PHP installation is loaded and works correctly. In most cases theses errors are caused by missing openssl module.

= How to send messages using just keyboard in multiline mode? =

After you type a message use the key combination: Shift + ENTER
